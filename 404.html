<blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Anarchists did not try to carry out genocide against the Armenians in Turkey; they did not deliberately starve millions of Ukrainians; they did not create a system of death camps to kill Jews, gypsies, and Slavs in Europe; they did not fire-bomb scores of large German and Japanese cities and drop nuclear bombs on two of them; they did not carry out a &#x2018;Great Leap Forward&#x2019; that killed scores of millions of Chinese; they did not attempt to kill everybody with any appreciable education in Cambodia; they did not launch one aggressive war after another; they did not implement trade sanctions that killed perhaps 500,000 Iraqi children.</p>
<p>In debates between anarchists and statists, the burden of proof clearly should rest on those who place their trust in the state. Anarchy&#x2019;s mayhem is wholly conjectural; the state&#x2019;s mayhem is undeniably, factually horrendous.&#x201D;</p>
