    <description>Welcome to the site of the Anarchist Engineer. Here you will find projects, write-ups, and "Blog" posts that I work on, just because. This could be anything from software development to hardware hacks. I'd love to say that I will publish something every (x) days (that's not true, I'd hate to say that), but I'm not making any commitments.</description>
